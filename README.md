## ðŸ“‹ **Problem & Solution**

### **The Challenge**
Teachers of young children increasingly struggle as they aim to provide personalized
lessons to each student depending on the studentâ€™s individual needs. While a classroom full of
students naturally feel individually challenged by various concepts, the pandemic exacerbated
the problem. During the pandemic, many students were in different places of mastery in their
lessons and teachers struggled to ensure that students continued their educations. However,
afterwards, as students began coming back to school, it became clear that students were
coming back at highly varying levels of education and social situational awareness.

### **Solution**
A comprehensive platform that allows teachers to:
- Transform lesson plans into engaging, personalized games for each student
- Provide self-paced, individualized learning experiences
- Track student progress and identify learning gaps
- Create multiplayer environments that foster community and motivation
- Deliver targeted homework assignments with clear explanations

## ***SetUp**
Split the terminal.
- In one terminal move into the backend folder. To launch, "npm start"
- In the other terminal, move into the main CANDY-STORE folder (the inner-most one). To launch, "npm run dev"
